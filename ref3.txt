When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    -when I want to collaborate and keep diff versions and track of my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   -changes may not be complete or we can use github from any other system rather than my own

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    -fork :cloning from one github profile to other.
    -clone:either from system to github or github to system.
    -branch:local only.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    when you are offline you can always know what happened after you left.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    -sittting together or by mails which would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

  the workflow when making changes in a separate branch is more complicated than working directly in master, especially when you need to stay up-to-date with changes others are making.
