How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It gave a bunch of difference between files making it easier to find bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

we can remember earlier made mistakes and changes which will help a lot in long run.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

pros:you will save if you do any logical change otherwise not to keep it simple.
cons:may not remember to save and then lose the idea/code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

To keep track of a repository after each commit makes lot easier to find differences.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all the commits that have been made to the repository.
git diff tell the difference between two versions of commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

because we can always go back to previous version of code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Save my versions of project and collabarate.
